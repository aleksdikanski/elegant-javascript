# Elegant Javascript

Given the, at the time, craze for functional programming in web development (redux, immutablejs, RxJS, etc), this is a likewise crazy project to compare these approaches with a pure Object-Oriented approach as described by [Yegor Bugayenko](http://www.yegor256.com Yegor Bugayenko Homepage) in his [Elegant Objects](http://www.yegor256.com/elegant-objects.html) series.

The main difference to Elegant Objects will be, that this is Javascript and a Web App and not Java in the Backend. Also worth mentioning: I do not have much experience as a frontend engineer/Web developer. Just an unsatisfied urge find other solutions. As I said, crazy stuff ...

As a disclaimer, I like to say, that I do not, in any case, have something against functional programming. In fact I very much appreciate the elegance of functional code. The motivation for this project stems from the experience, that Object-Orientation is mostly misunderstood and wrongly implementend, i.e. as 'procedural programming with classes'. What I gathered from the whay the Elegant Objects book series described, is that pure Object-Oriented code is very much (or rather should be more) like functional code in that it prefers immutability, composition (instead of inheritance), purism. But in Object-Orientation I don't have to know about Monads and Functors. In Object-Orientation everything is just an Object. 

I could also be very wrong...
